  ### Installation
  Copy/paste the code into your own application. Must be used with Node.js.
  If this is your first time using Node, run the following commands inside the terminal once installed:
``` 
npm init
npm i
npm i inquirer@8.2.4
```
  Those lines will install the necessary packages used to run the application.
  ### Usage
  Once installed, run the following command in your terminal:
  ```
  node index.js
  ```
  This will prompt a series of questions that, when all answered, will generate a README file based on the input data. If you re-named the specified file, please replace 'input.js' with the name you replaced it with.
